# Individual Card-Based Post Layout

## Goal Description
Redesign the announcements and blog pages so that each post is its own visually distinct "card" with its own background, rather than being items in a single list. This fulfills the user's request for "separating by post" and "different backgrounds per post" while keeping everything on the same page.

## Proposed Changes
---
### Styles ([style.css](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/style.css))
#### [MODIFY] style.css
- Update `.container` to act as a wrapper for multiple cards.
- Create a `.post-card` class that provides the separate background, padding, and margin for each post.
- Ensure the background stands out from the main page background.

---
### Announcements Page ([announcements.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/announcements.html))
#### [MODIFY] announcements.html
- Remove the `<ul>` list.
- Wrap each announcement in a `<div class="post-card">`.
- Include `<details>` inside each card for collapsible content.
- Add placeholders for the auto-date script.

---
### Blog Page ([blog.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/blog.html))
#### [MODIFY] blog.html
- Revert the local file link approach.
- Implement the same `.post-card` structure as the announcements page.
- Ensure each blog post is a distinct card on the same page.

---
### JavaScript (Common)
- Update the script to find all elements with a specific class (e.g., `.auto-date`) and populate them with the current time in `YY/MM/DD/HH:MM` format.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Check that [announcements.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/announcements.html) and [blog.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/blog.html) contain multiple `.post-card` elements.
- Verify that each card has the expected date format populated.

### Manual Verification
- View the pages to ensure each post looks like a separate "block" or "island" on the page background.
- Test the expand/collapse functionality for each card independently.
