# Site Guide and Theme Refinement Walkthrough

I have implemented several key updates to improve the user experience and visual clarity of the site guide.

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Dark Mode (Site-wide)
- Enforced dark mode as the default for all new users across the entire site (Home, Blog, Announcements, and individual posts).
- All HTML files and templates have been updated to check `localStorage` and default to `'dark'`.

### 2. Guide Visual Clarity
- **Blur Removal**: Removed the `backdrop-filter: blur(2px)` from the guide overlay. The background is now just dimmed, making it much easier to see the main content.
- **Brightness Fix**: Standardized z-indexes to ensure the guide bubble and character are never dimmed by their own highlight shadow.
  - `guide-overlay`: 20000
  - `guide-highlight`: 20001
  - `guide-content`: 20002

### 3. Smart Positioning Logic
- Redesigned the [repositionGuide](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html#175-215) function in [index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html).
- The guide bubble now aggressively positions itself to the **right** (or left) of the target element, rather than centering on it.
- This ensures that large content like the **YouTube video section** is never obscured by the guide.

## Verification
- GitHub update: [main 9830474]
- Verified that `localStorage` defaults to dark.
- Verified that the guide bubble stays clear of the YouTube iframe.

### How to Confirm
1. Open the site (Wait a few minutes for GH Pages to sync).
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` to clear cache.
3. Observe that the site starts in dark mode.
4. Watch the guide and notice the bubble stays to the side of the highlighted sections.
