# Site Guide Structural Fix Walkthrough

I have implemented a fundamental structural change to the site guide to ensure maximum visibility and clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Restructure (Decoupling)
- **Problem**: The guide bubble was nested inside the overlay. This created a "stacking context" issue where the highlight shadow would cover the bubble if they shared the same parent.
- **Solution**: Moved the `.guide-content` (the bubble) completely outside of the `.guide-overlay`. They are now sibling elements, allowing for independent layering.

### 2. Precise Layering (Z-Index Hierarchy)
- I've established a strict 3-layer system to ensure the bubble is always the brightest and top-most element:
  - **Layer 0 (10000)**: `.guide-overlay` (The dimmed background background)
  - **Layer 1 (10001)**: `.guide-highlight` (The massive shadow focusing on the target)
  - **Layer 2 (10002)**: `.guide-content` (The bright guide bubble and character)

### 3. Visual & Positioning Refinements
- **No Blur**: Removed the `backdrop-filter: blur` to keep the underlying content crisp.
- **Aggressive Positioning**: The bubble now stays strictly to the **side** of the target element with a 40px margin, ensuring it never overlaps the content being explained (especially the YouTube video).

## Verification Results
- Verified that the bubble remains bright and un-dimmed by the highlight shadow.
- Verified that the "YouTube Section" guide step correctly places the bubble outside the video frame.

### How to Confirm
1. Refresh the site (GH Pages takes 1-2 mins to sync).
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` to ensure the latest structural changes are loaded.
3. Observe the guide: the bubble should be vibrant and bright, and clearly separated from the target area.
