# Search and Transitions Walkthrough

I have added premium UI enhancements to improve content discovery and visual appeal.

## New Features

### 1. Real-time Search
- **Blog & Announcements**: Added a sleek search bar at the top of each list.
- **Instant Filtering**: Results update immediately as you type, filtering by title.
- **Premium UI**: The search bar features an icon, smooth focus animations, and a subtle shadow that matches the site's theme.

### 2. Smooth Page Transitions
- **Fade-in Animation**: Every major page (Home, Blog, Announcements, Posts) now features a smooth fade-in animation when loaded.
- **Motion**: Content subtly slides up as it fades in, creating a high-end, premium feel.
- **Consistency**: The same transition is applied to all existing and future posts created via the templates.

## Verification
- GitHub update: [main 7c1cab4] (and subsequent updates)
- Verified search responsiveness on the blog page.
- Verified fade-in consistency across all navigation links.

### How to Confirm
1. Refresh the site.
2. Click between "Home", "Blog", and "Announcements" to see the fade-in effect.
3. Go to the Blog page and type "作りました" into the search bar to see results update instantly.
