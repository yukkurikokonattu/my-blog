# Site Guide Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Add an interactive or semi-static "Site Guide" component to the homepage. This will use speech bubbles and a small character to explain the different sections (Blog/Updates, YouTube, Theme) to first-time visitors.

## Proposed Changes
### Root Directory
#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/style.css)
- **Speech Bubble Styles**: Create CSS for glassmorphed speech bubbles with a "tail" pointing to specific elements.
- **Helper Character**: Add styles for a small, cute character icon that appears next to the bubbles.
- **Animations**: Add fade-in and subtle float animations.

#### [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html)
- **Guide Overlay**: Add a hidden container for the guide.
- **Tour Script**:
    - Use `localStorage` to check if it's the user's first visit.
    - Define steps:
        1. Welcome message.
        2. Point to Blog/Announcements.
        3. Point to Subscribe button.
        4. Point to Theme toggle.
    - Add "Next" / "Close" buttons to the bubbles.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
1.  Clear browser `localStorage`.
2.  Reload the site and verify the guide starts automatically.
3.  Click through the steps and verify the bubbles point to the correct elements.
4.  Verify the guide doesn't reappear on subsequent reloads unless manually triggered (optional button).
