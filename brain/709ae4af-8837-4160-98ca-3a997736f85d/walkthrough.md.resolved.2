# Cleanup and Automation Walkthrough

I have implemented the requested cleanup and the automation for the YouTube latest video embed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Content Cleanup and New Scripts
- **Deleted old posts:** All `post*.html` (blog) and `news*.html` (announcement) files have been removed, while keeping the [post_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/post_template.html) and [news_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/news_template.html) for your future use.
- **Reset Indexes:** The [blog-posts.js](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/blog-posts.js) and [announcements.js](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/announcements.js) files have been updated to reflect that there are currently no posts.
- **New [create_post.bat](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/create_post.bat):** I've added a new batch file for creating blog posts, similar to the one for announcements. It's fully fixed and handles Japanese titles correctly.

### 2. YouTube Automation
- **[update-youtube-video.ps1](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/update-youtube-video.ps1):** A new script that automatically fetches the latest video ID from your YouTube channel (`UC9LpqPFPOh650jI6mO9Z2Xg`) and updates the homepage.
- **[publish_site.bat](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/publish_site.bat) Integration:** The publishing script now automatically:
    1.  Cleans up any inconsistent blog/news files.
    2.  Fetches and updates the latest YouTube video on the homepage.
    3.  Updates the blog/announcement indexes.
    4.  Uploads everything to GitHub.

### 3. Site Guide (First-time Visitor Tour)
- **Interactive Tour:** Added a "Site Guide" that uses speech bubbles and a helper icon to explain the site.
- **Sections covered:** It points out where to find the latest Blog/News, how to Subscribe, how to watch the latest YouTube video, and how to use the Theme Toggle.
- **Save State:** The guide only appears automatically on the first visit (uses `localStorage`).

## How to use
From now on, whenever you want to update your site or show a new video:
1.  Run **[publish_site.bat](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/publish_site.bat)**.
2.  It will automatically detect your latest YouTube video and update the home page for you!

## Verification Results
- **Cleanup:** Verified that index files are now empty [announcements.js](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/announcements.js).
- **Automation:** Verified that [index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html) now contains the latest video:
```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKWYwJGSnpM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```
*(ID `kKWYwJGSnpM` was fetched automatically during the process)*
