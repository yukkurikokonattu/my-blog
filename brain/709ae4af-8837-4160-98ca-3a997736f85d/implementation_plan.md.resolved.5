# Site Guide Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Add an interactive or semi-static "Site Guide" component to the homepage. This will use speech bubbles and a small character to explain the different sections (Blog/Updates, YouTube, Theme) to first-time visitors.

## Proposed Changes
### Root Directory
#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/style.css)
- **Z-Index Overhaul**:
    - Increase `.guide-overlay` z-index to `2000`.
    - Increase `.guide-content` z-index to `2001`.
    - Keep `.guide-highlight` at `1001` (so the guide sits *above* the highlight shadow).
- **Brightness Fix**:
    - Remove `backdrop-filter` from `.guide-overlay` as it might be dimming the child content in some rendering contexts.
    - Ensure `.guide-content` has a solid (non-transparent) `background: var(--card-bg)`.
- **Interaction Fix**:
    - Add `z-index` explicitly to any potentially problematic containers if `getBoundingClientRect` logic needs more stability.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
1.  Clear browser `localStorage`.
2.  Reload the site and verify the guide starts automatically.
3.  Click through the steps and verify the bubbles point to the correct elements.
4.  Verify the guide doesn't reappear on subsequent reloads unless manually triggered (optional button).
