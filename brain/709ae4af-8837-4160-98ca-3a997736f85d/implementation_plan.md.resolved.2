# Homepage Redesign Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Redesign the homepage ([index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html)) to prioritize new content (Blog and Announcements) by moving them to the top. Group the YouTube video and "Channel Registration" button together at the bottom.

## User Review Required
- **Layout Order**: Confirm if "Latest Blog" should come before "Latest Announcement" or vice-versa. (I will put Blog first as requested).

## Proposed Changes
### Root Directory
#### [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html)
- **Refine Layout Order**:
    1.  Main Title (`<h1>`)
    2.  Latest Blog & Announcement Section
    3.  Channel Registration Button (Moved up, separate) [REFINE]
    4.  Introduction/Text Card (Moved down)
    5.  YouTube Video Section (Separate card at bottom) [REFINE]
- **JavaScript Update**:
    - Include [announcements.js](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/announcements.js).
    - Add `loadLatestAnnouncement()` function to fetch and display the most recent announcement.
    - Update `loadLatestPost()` (already exists) to match the new style if needed.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
1.  Open [index.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/index.html) in a browser.
2.  Verify "Latest Blog" and "Latest Announcement" appear at the top.
3.  Verify the YouTube video and "Channel Registration" button are grouped at the bottom.
4.  Verify that clicking "記事を読む" and "詳細を見る" works correctly.
