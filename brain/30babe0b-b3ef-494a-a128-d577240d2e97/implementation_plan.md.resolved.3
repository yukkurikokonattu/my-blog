# Enable Image and Video Support in Blog and Announcements

The goal is to allow the user to easily insert images and videos into their blog posts and announcements.

## User Review Required
- **Video Hosting**: Do you want to upload video files directly to the site, or embed from YouTube? (Assumed: YouTube is preferred for bandwidth, but local video support might be needed). I will provide support for both if possible, or focus on responsive YouTube embeds and simple image tags.
- **Workflow**: Since you currently edit HTML files, I will likely add "snippets" or commented-out sections in the templates that you can uncomment and fill in.

## Proposed Changes

### CSS
- Update [style.css](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/style.css):
    - Improve `<details>` and `<summary>` styling to look like a button (`.spoiler-details`, `.spoiler-summary`).
    - Verify `.post-content img` has `max-width: 100%` and `object-fit: contain` to ensure images fit the screen.

### Scripts (Automation)
- Modify [create-post.ps1](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/create-post.ps1) and [create-announcement.ps1](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/create-announcement.ps1):
    - Wrap the injected `<img>` tags in a `<details>` block.
    - Structure:
      ```html
      <details class="media-accordion">
          <summary>画像を表示する</summary>
          <img src="..." ...>
      </details>
      ```

### Templates
- Update comments in [post_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/post_template.html) and [news_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/news_template.html) to show the `<details>` wrapper example.

### Templates
- Modify [post_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/post_template.html) and [news_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/news_template.html):
    - Ensure there is a specific marker (e.g., `<!-- INSERT_IMAGES_HERE -->`) inside the content area for the script to target, or simply appending to the end of the text.

### Scripts (Optional)
- If [create-post.ps1](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/create-post.ps1) exists, I might add a prompt, but template modification is usually safer and more flexible for manual editing.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Create a temporary test post manually (or via script).
- Insert an image and a YouTube video using the snippets.
- Verify responsiveness on mobile and desktop widths.
