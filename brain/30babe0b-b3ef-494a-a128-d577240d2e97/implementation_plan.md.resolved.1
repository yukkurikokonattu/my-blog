# Enable Image and Video Support in Blog and Announcements

The goal is to allow the user to easily insert images and videos into their blog posts and announcements.

## User Review Required
- **Video Hosting**: Do you want to upload video files directly to the site, or embed from YouTube? (Assumed: YouTube is preferred for bandwidth, but local video support might be needed). I will provide support for both if possible, or focus on responsive YouTube embeds and simple image tags.
- **Workflow**: Since you currently edit HTML files, I will likely add "snippets" or commented-out sections in the templates that you can uncomment and fill in.

## Proposed Changes

### CSS
- Update [style.css](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/style.css) to add:
    - `.post-content img, .post-content video`: Ensure they are responsive (`max-width: 100%`, `height: auto`), have rounded corners (`border-radius`), and a subtle shadow.
    - `.video-container`: Ensure the existing class works well within the post content.

### Templates
- Modify [post_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/post_template.html) and [news_template.html](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/news_template.html) to include commented-out snippets for:
    - **Image**: `<!-- <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"> -->`
    - **YouTube**: Use the existing `.video-container` wrapper.
    - **Video**: `<!-- <video controls src="video.mp4" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"></video> -->`

### Scripts (Optional)
- If [create-post.ps1](file:///c:/Users/maiku/.gemini/antigravity/create-post.ps1) exists, I might add a prompt, but template modification is usually safer and more flexible for manual editing.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Create a temporary test post manually (or via script).
- Insert an image and a YouTube video using the snippets.
- Verify responsiveness on mobile and desktop widths.
